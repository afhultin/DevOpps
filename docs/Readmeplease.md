1) Project overview

This project runs a Java servlet app in Tomcat and a PostgreSQL database in Docker.
There are two containers in this stack: db (PostgreSQL) and tomcat (Java web app).
DataGrip is the database client for this project. It is not a container.

How requests flow:
Browser -> Tomcat servlet -> PostgreSQL

2) Setup and run

Requirements:
- Docker Desktop running

Create a .env file in the repo root with:

DB_NAME=demo
DB_USER=demo
DB_PASSWORD=demo
DB_HOST_PORT=55432

Run from repo root:

docker compose down -v --remove-orphans
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose ps

Expected result:
- db is Up (healthy)
- tomcat is Up

App URL:
- http://localhost:8080

Important connection rule:
- App container connects to DB using db:5432 (internal Docker network)
- DataGrip connects from your machine using localhost:<DB_HOST_PORT>

3) Front End team guide

Where to edit frontend files in this repo:
- src/main/webapp/index.html

What to do:
1. Edit HTML/CSS/JS in src/main/webapp
2. Rebuild and run: docker compose up --build -d
3. Open http://localhost:8080 and verify the page

Before push:
- Confirm page loads in browser
- Confirm container status with docker compose ps
- Commit with a clear message, then push your branch

Push flow:
- git checkout -b feature/<name>
- git add .
- git commit -m "feat: update frontend page"
- git push -u origin feature/<name>

4) Back End team guide

Where to edit backend files:
- Servlets: src/main/java/com/example/web
- Tests: src/test/java/com/example/web

Current endpoints:
- /health returns OK
- /db-check checks DB connection and returns DB OK or DB FAIL

DataGrip connection settings:
- Host: localhost
- Port: value in .env for DB_HOST_PORT (currently 55432)
- Database: value in .env for DB_NAME
- User: value in .env for DB_USER
- Password: value in .env for DB_PASSWORD

Build/test cycle:
- mvn -DskipTests package
- mvn test
- docker compose up --build -d

Before push:
- Endpoint checks:
  - http://localhost:8080/health
  - http://localhost:8080/db-check
- Tests pass with mvn test

5) QA team guide

How to run for testing:
1. docker compose down -v --remove-orphans
2. docker compose up --build -d
3. docker compose ps

What to test:
- App home page loads: http://localhost:8080
- Health endpoint returns OK: http://localhost:8080/health
- DB endpoint returns DB OK: http://localhost:8080/db-check

If /db-check fails:
- Confirm db is healthy in docker compose ps
- Confirm .env values are correct
- Confirm no other local process is taking the DB host port

6) Common issues

Port already in use:
- Change DB_HOST_PORT in .env (example 55433)
- Restart: docker compose down -v --remove-orphans then docker compose up --build -d

Docker engine not running:
- Start Docker Desktop and wait until it is fully ready

App not updating after edits:
- Rebuild with docker compose up --build -d

This setup is for development and team handoff, not production hardening.

7) First time Committing
    -Create a fork them commit using GitHub Desktop; this is YOUR FORK not editing class repo yet
    -Open your fork: ex: https://github.com/rdupart/DevOpps
    -Click Contribute → Open pull request
    -Base repo: 2026-Spring-A451-Wolfe/DevOpps, -base branch: main
    -Compare repo: rdupart/DevOpps, compare -branch: main
    -Create PR
8. Database Management
    -The folder db is where the final database is
    -in Datagrip db team will create and maintain schemas, write documentation so changes made in datagrip are tracked, validate queries/endpoitns against real data
    -Instructions:
        1. Start Stack:docker compose up --build -d
        2. In datagrip connect it by inputting: Host: localhost
        Port: 55432
        DB/user/pass: from .env
        3. Make chnages to the database via datagrip editor, and once done save sql script chnages in the db folder; ex:db/migrations/001_init.sql
        Tip: having a convention is a good idea for ex: db/migrations, db/seeds, etc.
